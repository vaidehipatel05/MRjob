"What is left out of this article is the fact that the Democratic Party squelched Bernie out in 2016. And so did the media including the NY Times. The Democratic Party is split between the centrist and leftist sectors. The centrists and monied interests were threatened by Sanders determination to confront corporatists and big money and backed Hillary with a vengeance.  In fact the Democrats needed the money she brought in and were frightened to lose it. So they chose Hillary and it worked to some extent. She won the popular vote but not the electoral college and so now we have what we have.  But perhaps the charisma of Donald Trump might have been better matched by the charisma of Bernie whose populist agenda is actually real while Trump's is not. Maybe the people are waking up to the fact that the people have been duped by Dems who give voice to genuine concerns but who are stymied by the moneys they depend on.

"Why are the players not being punished? Because they have a strong Union and to get them to talk without pleading the fifth the commish had to basically grant them immunity.

If he went after the players the entire team would be suspended because they all knew about it and every hitter used it. And although the players are receiving no formal punishment they are going to be punished in the court of public opinion. I am looking forward to seeing the reception the Astros get when they visit Yankee stadium. Bonds was never officially found guilty  on the PED issue but it has haunted him over the years. Except for Astro fans their 2017 World Series win will always have the word fraud attached to it.\""	[0.0, "Neutral"]
