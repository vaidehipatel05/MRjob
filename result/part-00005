We reached the bomb first due to the intensity of the Manhattan project which outclassed the efforts anywhere else. If we had not developed the bomb when we did Germany could have done it within a few years and Russia and Japan soon after that. This was without any espionage giving away secrets. And all nuclear bomb design efforts were littered with leakers because the scientists themselves were very troubled about what might happen if only one country had the bomb. It was felt by many that the safest thing was to give the bomb to Russia as quickly as possible. Once that happened the US could not attack the USSR with a nuclear first strike as the military wanted to do.
