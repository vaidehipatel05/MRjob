Banksy gets society thinking about controversial topics with his unique view via his art works. Many a time I burst out laughing when looking at his art work and it makes me realise people who view life from a different perspective and draw attention to hypocrisy in society are great artists. All artists have a right not to be exploited just like all people have a right not to be exploited. Intellectual property is worth money and his street art and art works are intellectual property. A lot of his artwork on walls in run down places are deliberately put there and is sold by local Councils to help poor youth and other charity groups and it is done with that intent. Without Banksy paintings lots of poor communities wouldn't be able to fund themselves. Banksy is the best thought provoking artist of our time. Banksy is misunderstood and anyone successful and famous is always picked on by the media. Why on earth would he want anyone to know whom he is"	[0.5267, "Positive"]
