However research thirty years ago   discovered that  in a tiny dose eg 10% it works for over 200 conditions! I prescribe it a lot in association with standard drugs. The number of psychiatric hospital admissions  is way down and it is an antidepressant without any major side effects. See LDN (www.lowdosenaltrexone.org) and www.ldnscience.org for example.It works for physical conditions too especially severe pain but it cannot be used with opiates. I have  over 100 LDN patients  for Fibromyalgia as it is quite useful in reducing the severe pain. It costs very little too. It is amazing that so much can be done and nobody does it.\""	[0.0, "Neutral"]
